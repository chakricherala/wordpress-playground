# Query API

WordPress Playground exposes a simple API that you can use to configure the Playground in the browser.

It works by passing configuration options as query parameters to the Playground URL. For example, to install the pendant theme, you would use the following URL:

```text
https://playground.wordpress.net/?theme=pendant
```

You can go ahead and try it out. The Playground will automatically install the theme and log you in as an admin. You may even embed this URL in your website using an `<iframe>` tag:

```html
<iframe src="https://playground.wordpress.net/?theme=pendant"></iframe>
```

This must be used in combination with `storage=browser`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

For example, the following code embeds a Playground with a preinstalled Gutenberg plugin, and opens the post editor:

```html
<iframe src="https://playground.wordpress.net/?plugin=gutenberg&url=/wp-admin/post-new.php&mode=seamless"> </iframe>
```

## GitHub Export Options

The following additional query parameters may be used to pre-configure the GitHub export form:

-   `gh-ensure-auth`: If set to `yes`, Playground will display a modal to ensure the
    user is authenticated with GitHub before proceeding.
-   `ghexport-repo-url`: The URL of the GitHub repository to export to.
-   `ghexport-pr-action`: The action to take when exporting (create or update).
-   `ghexport-playground-root`: The root directory in the Playground to export from.
-   `ghexport-repo-root`: The root directory in the repository to export to.
-   `ghexport-content-type`: The content type of the export (plugin, theme, wp-content, custom-paths).
-   `ghexport-plugin`: Plugin path. When the content type is `plugin`, pre-select the plugin to export.
-   `ghexport-theme`: Theme directory name. When the content type is `theme`, pre-select the theme to export.
-   `ghexport-path`: A path relative to `ghexport-playground-root`. Can be provided multiple times. When the
    content type is `custom-paths`, it pre-populates the list of paths to export.
